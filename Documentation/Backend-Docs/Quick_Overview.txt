Quick overview — what we’ll build first

A Node.js + Express REST API + Socket.IO server

MongoDB (Mongoose) data models: Driver, Bus, Route, Assignment, LocationLog, User, Admin

JWT authentication for drivers/admins

Socket.IO flow: authenticated driver emits location updates → server stores & broadcasts to clients

Small dummy front-end pages (static HTML/JS) to simulate driver and passenger behavior

Dev tooling: nodemon, Postman / curl tests, Docker setup for easy delivery


Prerequisites (install needed)

Node.js (>=16), npm

MongoDB (local or use MongoDB Atlas)

VS Code 

Postman (or use curl)
